## Buildings

There are two building datasets available from the Queensland Government, [Building areas - Queensland](http://qldspatial.information.qld.gov.au/catalogue/custom/detail.page?fid={BC24B68C-50D2-41E8-B0AE-FF4EB2913FDA}) which only includes large footprint buildings but has accurate geometries, and [Generated building outlines - Queensland](http://qldspatial.information.qld.gov.au/catalogue/custom/search.page?q=%22Generated%20building%20outlines%20-%20Queensland%22) which includes all buildings but has less accurate geometries. We have selected the latter to provide better coverage.
