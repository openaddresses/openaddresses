Below are examples where there appear to be 2 house numbers that prefix the street but the lat/lon's on other mapping sites supply no proof of this.  On Google street view, these appear to be gated housing complexes.  If the house number is really the first number, complicating regexes is that numeric street names lack the ordinal identifiers.",
