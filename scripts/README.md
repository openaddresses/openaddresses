The `scripts` directory contains import scripts that preprocess data from individual sources that take forms too complex to be prepared by OpenAddresses' automated data-cleaning scripts. 

Most users of OpenAddresses should not need these files, as they will have been used by others to create data that is appropriate for the `conform` process. That data is what an individual `source.json` file will point to.

However, if a datasource needs to be refreshed or otherwise repaired, these scripts may be of use.
