New Zealand Countrywide Data
====

Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) provides downloadable address data from
its data service website at https://data.linz.govt.nz. The file requires a
user account to retrieve, so it must be cached using this script.

More information at https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/779-nz-street-address-electoral/

Using Docker
----

`lds-nz.sh` contains a script for caching LDS data. You will need to provide
a copy of _Street Address (Electoral)_ data, which can be downloaded from
Land Information New Zealand’s website. See _Getting Data_ below.

`Dockerfile` contains a Docker process for caching data. Docker allows for code
execution in a controlled environment. On Ubuntu, Docker can be installed with
apt-get install docker.io.

    # prepare a temporary work directory for Docker
    mkdir /tmp/work
    chgrp docker /tmp/work
    chmod ugo+rwxt /tmp/work
    cp lds-nz-street-address-electoral-SHP.zip /tmp/work/

    # build docker image from cache
    curl http://data.openaddresses.io/cache/nz/nz-docker-6f346f299.tar.bz2 | bzcat | docker load
    
    # image can alternatively be built the slow way
    docker build -t nz-lds .

    # run cache, leaving data in work directory
    docker run --volume /tmp/work:/work nz-lds /usr/local/bin/run-cache

    # upload contents of cache directory to S3
    aws s3 sync --acl public-read /tmp/work/cache s3://data.openaddresses.io/cache
