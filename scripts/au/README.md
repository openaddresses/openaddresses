Using Docker
----

`gnaf.sh` contains a script for caching G-NAF data with
[gnaf-loader](https://github.com/minus34/gnaf-loader).

`Dockerfile` contains a Docker process for caching G-NAF. Docker allows for
code execution in a controlled environment. On Ubuntu, Docker can be installed
with `apt-get install docker.io`.

    # prepare a temporary work directory for Docker
    mkdir /tmp/work
    chgrp docker /tmp/work
    chmod ugo+rwxt /tmp/work
    
    # build docker image
    docker build -t au-gnaf .
    
    # run cache, leaving data in work directory
    docker run --volume /tmp/work:/work au-gnaf /usr/local/bin/run-cache
    
    # upload contents of cache directory to S3
    aws s3 sync --acl public-read /tmp/work/cache s3://data.openaddresses.io/cache
