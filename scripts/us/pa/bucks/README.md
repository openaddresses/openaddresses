Bucks County Data
====

Bucks County, PA parcel data can be viewed using the
[Floodplain Viewer](https://gisweb.co.bucks.pa.us/apps/floodplainviewer/).

Using Docker
----

`cache.sh` contains a script for caching county data. You will need to provide
an ESRI map token, which can be found on the Floodplain viewer website. See
_Getting A Token_ below.

`Dockerfile` contains a Docker process for caching data. Docker allows for code
execution in a controlled environment. On Ubuntu, Docker can be installed with
`apt-get install docker.io`.

    # prepare a temporary work directory for Docker
    mkdir /tmp/work
    chgrp docker /tmp/work
    chmod ugo+rwxt /tmp/work

    # build the Docker image
    docker build -t us-pa-bucks .

    # run cache, leaving data in work directory
    docker run --volume /tmp/work:/work us-pa-bucks /usr/local/bin/run-cache <TOKEN>

    # upload contents of cache directory to S3
    aws s3 sync --acl public-read /tmp/work/cache s3://data.openaddresses.io/cache
