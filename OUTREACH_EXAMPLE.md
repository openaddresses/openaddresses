Hello {GIS CONTACT (if available)},

I am writing on behalf of the [OpenAddresses Project](http://openaddresses.io/), an open-source volunteer initiative working to collect and standardize address data for the world.

To best secure this information, I would like to ask for your assistance in adding {COUNTRY/REGION/CITY}'s geo-point data for inclusion in this important and impactful project.

Specifically, I would appreciate your help in securing the following address point data:

* Address (house # and street name)

* Latitude/Longitude

If this cannot be accessed, the parcel information on addresses would help greatly.

We believe that data is important and should be available to everyone through project like the OpenAddresses project, as well as others like [OpenStreetMap](http://osm.org). Collaborating with me in building out this data from {COUNTRY/REGION/CITY} for inclusion in this project would be very helpful. Should you have any questions, please contact me at {EMAIL ADDRESS} or via phone at {PHONE NUMBER}.

I thank you for your time and assistance on this amazing project for our communities across the country, and across the world.

Sincerely,
{NAME}
